First, we created a single DFA for identifiers, integers, strings, comments, relational operators, and IO operators. Then, we moved on and wrote the regular definitions of these by consulting the DFA. Lastly, we did the coding part by writing a program that identifies tokens and their respective lexemes for keywords, relational operators, special characters, arithmetic operators, other constructs, strings, comments, assignment operators, starting blocks, closing blocks, and IO operators. We followed both the DFA (i.e., its states represent cases) and the regular definitions (i.e., for token names) while coding for identifiers, integers, strings, comments, relational operators, and IO operators, while the others were done independently. We did not encounter any problems while doing the assignment and were able to complete it without any hassle.
